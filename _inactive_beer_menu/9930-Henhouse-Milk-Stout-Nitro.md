long_desc: "This Milk Stout features de-bittered black malt and English brown malt along with a healthy portion of lactose. Unlike most sugars lactose does not get taken up by brewing yeasts and turned into alcohol. Instead it remains in the body of this decadent brew to provide a signature richness of texture and flavor. Come get this winter-y plush chocolate-ness in your life."
