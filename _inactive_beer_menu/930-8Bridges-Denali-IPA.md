long_desc: "The second version of our One Box series, the One Box Denali has a light, somewhat malty base with a solid IPA bitterness level that was dry hopped with a whole box of Denali, a new variety of hop with a higher than normal essential oil content that makes this hop unique and imparts a lot of aroma in the beer. Pineapple aromas dominate. Flavor takes on a tropical taste."
