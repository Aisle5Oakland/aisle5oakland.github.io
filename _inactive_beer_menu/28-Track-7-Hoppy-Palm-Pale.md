long_desc: "The product of that hop selection, Hoppy Palm Pale Ale, has been aggressively dry-hopped with Cascade, Chinook, and Galaxy hops, producing an American Pale Ale with a light body and minimal sweetness. If you pay close attention, youâ€™ll notice tropical notes from the Galaxy hops, with the Cascade hops giving it a hint of citrus as well. "
