long_desc: "Nutty Operator is a peanut butter version of Smooth Operator, a smooth, rich, full-bodied oatmeal stout. Heavy on the oats and chocolate malt, this complex beer balances out with a medium roast character, followed by huge flavors and aromas of peanut butter; like drinking a Reeseâ€™s Peanut Butter Cup."
