long_desc: "We have called it a California Tea Beer due to its construction using local California ingredients, from the oats, barley, and wheat to the fresh coriander, chamomile, and sweet orange peel. A true taste of California in all its beauty, the Golden State of Mind is also a Gruit â€“ meaning it is made without hops. "
