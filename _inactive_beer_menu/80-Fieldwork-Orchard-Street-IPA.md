long_desc: "Orchard Street has made its return after a year on the shelf awaiting this year's crops of Amarillo hops. An all Pilsner malt and oat grist-bill paves a smooth road for the boatload of the best Amarillo hops we can find; giving it big notes of ruby red grapefruit, pink starburst, watermelon rind, and a tidal wave of freshly juiced peaches."
