long_desc: "With over 300lbs of Boysenberry puree this one is a special, Fall treat. It starts off as a light Belgian style beer with hints of coriander and cinnamon spice from a special yeast strain. We then add the prodigious amount of Boysenberry puree for a nice refreshing fruit and beer balance. Juicy and Boysenberry-fruity, this is a delicious seasonal delight."
