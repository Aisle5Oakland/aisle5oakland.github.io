long_desc: "As dry and crisp as a Double IPA has ever been, the notes of pineapple, honeydew melon, grapefruit, and starfruit rain down on the palate leaving it drenched in hop perfection. With abnormally low bitterness and malt character, unparalleled dryness and hop aroma; Broken Clouds is a Double IPA upon itself residing on the corner of Crushable Court and Aroma Avenue."
