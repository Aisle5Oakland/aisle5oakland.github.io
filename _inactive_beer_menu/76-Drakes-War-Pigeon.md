long_desc: "What starts as a faint hum builds to a roaring crescendo as the War Pigeons take to the sky. A telegraphed warning comes over the wire, but it’s too late. You’ve been hit. We deployed the freshest hops in our hop arsenal and the payload is a blast of dank, floral citrus. Surrender to the aromatic blitzkrieg as the hops rain down."
