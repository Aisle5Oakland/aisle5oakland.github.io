long_desc: "A slightly tart, refreshing ale brewed with lime, pink Himalayan sea salt, and fresh Mango. The lime leaves a soft citrus fragrance to this light and sessionable ale perfect for a sunny day. Originally brewed in collaboration with the Pink Boots Society, this Gose won a Bronze medal at the California State Fair Beer competition for session beers."
