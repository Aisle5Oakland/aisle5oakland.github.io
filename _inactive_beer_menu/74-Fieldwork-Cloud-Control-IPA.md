long_desc: "With a well-balanced body and subtle malt profile, the only thing over-the-top is the amount of Citra, El Dorado, and Dr. Rudi hops we used in this beer. This trio of hops creates a total fruit salad of tropical aromas and juicy flavors ranging from guava to grapefruit chunks to orange zest."
