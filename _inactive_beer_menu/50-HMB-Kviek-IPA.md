long_desc: "Kveik is a Scandinavian Farmhouse yeast that ferments at warmer than normal temperatures with very subtle esters. This yeast is called Hornidal and is known to impart peach, apricot and other subtle stone fruit flavors. We hopped it up with Citra, El Dorado and Idaho 7 for a super apricot jam delight."
