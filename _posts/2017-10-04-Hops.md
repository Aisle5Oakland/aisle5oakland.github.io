Today we briefly profile two hops used in one of our draft beers. The [Alpine Brewing Company Duet](http://alpinebeerco.com/duet/) a longtime staff favorite, uses two hops: Amarillo and Simcoe.

Amarillo hops are commonly used for aroma. They give off a citrus scent, moreso along grapefruit lines, and can be quite pungent.

Simcoe hops are very popular with both home and craft brewers. Itâ€™s a diverse variety, and can be used to brew any kind of IPA variety. Simcoe blesses us with woody, musky and citrusy notes.

The Alpine Duet offers a blast of resinous aromatics with notes of evergreen pine, orange zest, and hints of cedar. Big hoppy flavors mingle with geranial notes, while hints of citrus fruit and an overall lingering piney quality lend a touch of complexity to an otherwise simple and delicious IPA
