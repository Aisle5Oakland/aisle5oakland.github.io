We currently have [Ale Industries](http://www.aleindustries.com/) “Gose Ride the Whip” on tap at Aisle 5. It’s of the “gose” (pronounced goes-uh) variety. These are sour, almost salty styles of beer that originated in Germany. “Gose Ride the Whip” rolls in at 4.4% ABV, and fans of sour beers will certainly enjoy its lemony bite. Ale Industries is based in Oakland, so come on by to try some home-grown beer before it’s all gone!
