title: What makes it a Kolsch?

The name comes from the beer’s origins in Cologne, Germany. It is unique because when it was first brewed in the early 20th century, most beers in Germany were bottom-fermented beers (see: lagers). Kolschs are top- and warm-fermented, and then conditioned by lagering at colder temperatures. So a kolsch is technically an ale, but tastes very similar to German lagers. We’ve got Pine Street Brewery Free City Kolsch currently pouring at Aisle 5. If you like lagers, come by to try it out!
