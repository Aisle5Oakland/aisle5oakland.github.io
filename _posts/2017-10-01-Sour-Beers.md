title: What makes a sour beer tart?

It’s all in the bacteria and yeast that the brewer decides to go with. Some common wild yeast strains you’ll find in sours are Lactobacillus, Acetobacter and Brettanomyces. They all bring different flavors forward. Lactobacillus has a yogurt tang to it, Acetobacter has a bitterness more akin to that of a vinegar, and Brettanomyces wafts with an earthy aroma.  We’ve currently got Cali Craft’s Sour Zinfandel brew on tap at Aisle 5. As part of their wine barrel project, this sour is brewed with Brettanomyces and wild wine yeasts. We’ll soon tap Barebottle’s Sacred Tart, which gets its tartness from the Lactobacillus strain.
