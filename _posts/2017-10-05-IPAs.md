If you like India Pale Ales, weâ€™ve got you covered at Aisle 5. No, this style was not invented in India, as the name may seem to indicate. Its name stems from Imperial Britain. The British love their beer, and, during their colonial days, they needed beer shipped to all their outposts around the world. Back then beer did not travel well. However more aggressively-hopped beers seemed to fare better on the long sea voyages. And so these beers became popular with the British clientele and traders in India, and the beverages were named as such.Right now we have five different IPAs on draft at Aisle 5. A current staff favorite is HenHouse Brewing Company Phantom Time, clocking in at 6.3% ABV. Come by to try it (andthe other four)!
