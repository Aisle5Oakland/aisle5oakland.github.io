long_desc: "A brew inspired by a Munich Dunkel lager. Except we used a kölsch yeast and fermented at a lower temperature to give it a more neutral yeast profile. Munich style malts in the grain bill, including Admiral Maltings’ Admiral’s Harth malts. Rich, warm bready character on the nose, with the mild fruity presence of kölsch yeast."
