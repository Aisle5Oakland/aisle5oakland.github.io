long_desc: "Dinosaur Statues is a 7.3% ABV celebration of the unique. Using some of our favorite imported hops this mammoth IPA avoids conformity with a hop profile different from the rest; emitting such colossal notes of ripe pear, papaya, cantaloupe, and honeysuckle that you can smell it from the freeway and it'll put a smile on your face."
