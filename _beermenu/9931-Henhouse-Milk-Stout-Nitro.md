long_desc: "Our addition of unfermentable milk sugar enhances the body and adds a touch of background sweetness to round the edges off all that roasty, fluffy goodness. The delicious little chocolate cloud in your glass is our tribute to all the hard-working people (and cows) of the North Bay dairy industry. Rich and delicious."
