long_desc: "Using wild wine yeast straight from the vineyard and pomace straight from the press, Calicraft infuses this sour ale with Cabernet grape skins. Tart and bold, full-bodied and dry. It starts with dark fruit flavors and finishes with tannins, tobacco, and vanilla. Blur the line between beer and wine."
