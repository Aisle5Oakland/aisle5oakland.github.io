long_desc: "Grove Stand Double IPA is an absolute juice bomb of a beer. Before this beer even parks in front of you, you'll smell it coming, a rocket launcher of pineapple juice and orange marmalade explode your senses, followed up with an assault of even more fresh cut pineapple, overripe mango, and a hint of orange pith."
