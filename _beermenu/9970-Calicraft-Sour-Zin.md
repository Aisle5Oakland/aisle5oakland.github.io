long_desc: "Using wild wine yeast straight from the vineyard and pomace straight from press, we infuse this sour ale with Dry Creek Valley zinfandel skins. Tart and jammy, juicy but dry. It starts fruit-forward with notes of bright red berries and finishes with wood spice and soft tannins. Blur the line between beer and wine."
