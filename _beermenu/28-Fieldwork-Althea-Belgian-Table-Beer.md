long_desc: "A dusting of Belma hops add nice floral notes in the background and a brilliant finish akin to the fruity white center of a strawberry picked just a few days too early. These light malt and hop flavors blend seamlessly with the effervescent Belgian yeast blend that sprinkles esters of lemon zest and freshly baled hay."
