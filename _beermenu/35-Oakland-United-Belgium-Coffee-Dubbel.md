long_desc: "This rich and malty ale is an interesting variation of a classic Belgian Dubbel. Brewed with RoastCo Coffee from West Oakland, we added their cold-brewed Ethiopian Guji after the fermentation process to enrich this ale with its fig and blueberry notes. Perfectly complementing the dried fruit characteristics from the malt, the coffee flavor is subtle at the finish."
