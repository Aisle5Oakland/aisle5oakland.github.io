long_desc: "Pale in color with a blizzard of haze, there is no apology for its appearance. Fresh juice notes jump out of the glass and jump on your palate like they're taking stage at Wembley, followed by sticky dank hop and bright citrus aromas. Flavor is weighed down heavily with fresh cut start fruit, honeydew melon, grapefruit, and a zip lock freezer bag of the highest grade weed your roadies could score."
