long_desc: "With a malt bill consisting solely of our base malt and a pale malt from England, Daypack remains bone dry with a joyous background of simple bready and biscuit-like notes. Its Citra heavy dry hop creates a medley of tropical and juicy flavors that jump right out of the beer, only to be followed up with equally intense hoppy notes of apricot, Asian pear, mango, and orange zest."
