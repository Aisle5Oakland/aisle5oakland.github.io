long_desc: "A grainbill consisting of solely Fieldwork's base malt helps this pale ale weigh in at a sturdy 5.8% ABV, all while leaving it dry as a bone and as pale as a straw of hay. With no crystal or character malt to get in the way, Watershed is all about the hops from start to finish. Fieldwork dry hopped this Extra Pale Ale with the same amount of hops used in their double IPA, leaving it with a massive tropical nose."
