long_desc: "Large in stature and menacingly juicy, Tiger Uppercut Double IPA will artfully attack the senses like it has eight well-trained limbs. Jumping into the ring with some of our favorite hops; notes of cantaloupe and sweet peach waft through the air slowly morphing into an aroma of bright citrus and weed sorbet."
