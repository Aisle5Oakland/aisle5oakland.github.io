long_desc: "This IPA was brewed with a blank canvas of a grain bill consisting only of Fieldwork's domestic base malt, then added in an obscene amount of Amarillo hops to develop a huge ruby red grapefruit and pink starburst character, only to be followed by El Dorado hop influenced secondary notes of papaya, fresh peaches, citron, and navel oranges, ending with a faint note of key lime pie."
