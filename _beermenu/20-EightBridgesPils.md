long_desc: "This Bavarian styled pilsner starts with all German ingredients to which is added a bit of noble hop for a little spiciness. The wonderfully malty aroma, that is classic to this style, is balanced with a noble hop character. The beer is crystal clear, straw colored with a brilliant white head."
