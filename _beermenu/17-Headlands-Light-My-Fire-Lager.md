long_desc: "Brewed in the classic German tradition of a Munich Style Helles, with the twist of modifying the base malt to include 50% Beechwood Smoked Barley. The resulting beer has intense smoky aroma, reminiscent of a Holiday Spiraled Ham and flavors of wood smoked bacon, with the clean and bready finish of an authentic Lager. "
