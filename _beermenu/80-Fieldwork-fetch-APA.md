long_desc: "Fetch is a trapeze act with the hops being the star of the show swinging wildly above a safety net of its heavy bodied malt safety net. Chewy with a complex malt backbone; hop aromas start with massive notes of grapefruit and guava, shifting mid palate to vibrant citrus pith, finishing with a sherbet-like tropical juice character."
