long_desc: "Full Kit Wanker is one of the more tropical juice bombs we have ever cranked out. Using hops from around the world; Mosaic (Washington), Southern Star (South Africa), Waimea (New Zealand), and Blanc (Germany), this IPA kicks up a fruit-forward aromatic bouquet with notes of honeydew melon, peach sorbet, blueberries, and sauvignon blanc grapes.
