long_desc: "C+C Mosaic Factory is just that beer; a juicy cannon of Mosaic hops and floor-malted English barley that sticks to the inside of your glass while making the outside of it sweat sweat. Those Mosaic hops flex hard like theyâ€™re shirtless in a leather vest kicking up flavors of melon, grapefruit, lime zest, peach juice, and a slight background note of a freshly rolled spliff."
