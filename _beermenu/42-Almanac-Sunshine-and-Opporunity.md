long_desc: "Sunshine & Opportunity is a mixed fermentation saison brewed with oats and wheat, fermented with a blend of our house brewerâ€™s yeast, brettanomyces and lactobacillus, and aged in oak barrels and foedres. Finally, the beer is dry-hopped with a delicate touch of Citra hops for an aroma of lemon-lime and peach skin."
