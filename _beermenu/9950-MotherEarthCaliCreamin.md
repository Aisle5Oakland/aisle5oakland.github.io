long_desc: "This vanilla cream ale has a malty backbone thanks to some flaked corn and honey malt. Just a hint of vanilla adds depth to the flavor and makes this beer a medium bodied cult classic. It’s sure to woo the ladies, but also flavorful enough to satisfy the dudes. You’ll swear you were drinking a cream soda."
