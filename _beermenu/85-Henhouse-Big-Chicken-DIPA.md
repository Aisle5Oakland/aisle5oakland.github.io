long_desc: "Big Chicken is HenHouse Brewing Company’s once-a-year experiment in freshness, and a study in hop excess. We take everything that we’ve learned about making hoppy beer in a year, brew an over-the-top Double IPA, and then keg, deliver and get the entire batch of Big Chicken tapped the same day."
