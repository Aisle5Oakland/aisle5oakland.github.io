long_desc: "The beer is 100% brewed with pilsner malt and enough grain to bring the ABV up to 5.10%, an homage to our city's area code. Noble Tettnanger and Saaz hops are used throughout the brewing process to create pleasantly spicy herbal fragrances and flavors. We drop the temperature during fermentation to refine qualities of pilsner malt for an even more crisp and clean finish."
