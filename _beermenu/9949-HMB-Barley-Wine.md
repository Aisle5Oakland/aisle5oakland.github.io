long_desc: "We have taken it to the limit with this American-style Barleywine. By far the biggest beer we have ever made. It displays a deep amber color with Crystal and Munich malts. While presenting strong fruity-esters, the hops identify this as an American take on a classic. The high alcohol is evident but subdued by the oak and char from the bourbon barrels"
