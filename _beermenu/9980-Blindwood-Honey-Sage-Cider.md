long_desc: "Infused with locally sourced culinary sage from Santa Cruz farms and wildflower honey from Sonoma County. This cider creates subtle layers between delicate herbal sage aromatics, a sweet floral undertone of honey and crisp dry cider.  Although this cider is infused with honey, it maintains dryness while still being easy to drink and subtly sweet."
