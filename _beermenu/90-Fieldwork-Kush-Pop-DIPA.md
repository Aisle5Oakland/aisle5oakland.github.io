long_desc: "Kush-Pop Double IPA is primarily a Citra and Lemondrop hopped beer with massive citrus aromas of orange marmalade and lemon-lime soda. Backing up the aforementioned Fanta-flavored hops is a second dry-hopping made up of half dank and half citrus focused hops that add another layer of complexity and a bit of kush to help things pop."
